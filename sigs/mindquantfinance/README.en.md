## MindSpore Quantitative Finance SIG

Quantitative Finance combines mathematical models and financial models, coupled with computer programming, to conduct quantitative analysis of financial markets and transactions. Quantitative finance combines mathematics, statistics, computer science and finance, and is a typical interdisciplinary subject. Pricing of financial derivatives is one of the most widely used scenarios in the field of quantitative finance. Financial derivatives are collectively referred to as a special category of financial products traded, mainly including futures, options, forward contracts, swaps and contracts for difference. Financial derivatives pricing is a computationally intensive application, the main idea of which is to solve SDE (Stochastic Differential Equation) or PDE (Partial Differential Equation) with the support of computer hardware and software. Commonly used solving methods include Monte Carlo simulation, finite difference, and neural network. In this context, MindSpore Quantitative Finance Special Interest Group (abbreviation: Quantitative Finance SIG) was formally established and recruited like-minded partners from the open source community.

## The Mission of the Quantitative Finance SIG

Financial derivatives are an indispensable hedging tool in modern financial markets. Since the 1990s, my country's off-exchange derivatives market has developed rapidly, occupying an important position in the world and playing an important role in economics and finance. Among them, the pricing of derivative products is a major issue for maintaining the health of the financial derivatives market. Under the background of the rapid development of artificial intelligence and the continuous trend of high frequency in the financial market, it is meaningful to combine reasonable and effective models and methods, use AI and computer hardware resources to innovate, and create a quantitative financial library suitable for modern theory and science and technology. of. Quantitative Finance SIG intends to combine modern science and technology and the theory of derivative financial instruments to reasonably price derivative products to solve the problem of financial derivative pricing. The group mainly carried out work in the following directions:

### · Build quantitative financial classic models

Combining with the MindSpore framework, build a unified quantitative financial pricing model, establish classic models such as BlackScholes, Heston, and CIR, and provide unified The interface facilitates the use and migration of models.

### · Research on AI combined with quantitative financial issues

Combining the MindSpore framework and PINN, Forward Backward SDE, Neural SDE and other neural network models to help solve the pain points of traditional pricing models, using the deep learning function provided by MindSpore to conduct AI+quantitative financial research and build creative and efficient modern pricing tools.

### · Jointly build MindSpore “quantitative financial suite”

Based on the full-scenario AI framework MindSpore, it implements a series of solvers for quantitative financial models, targeting the needs of typical industrial fields. This enables the quantitative finance industry to make full use of the advanced computing power provided by modern accelerators such as GPUs and Ascend, accelerate traditional models and simulation methods, and create highly efficient quantitative financial suites. The quantitative finance suite includes interest rate, financial time series, optimization solver and basic mathematics library, providing a complete set of data collection, processing, modeling and application processes to form an "end-to-end" quantitative financial problem solution.

## Quantitative Finance SIG Work Plan

### Initial Phase：

Focusing on members' academic exchange activities, monthly online exchange activities are organized to introduce the research progress and discuss the difficulties in the research work around the scientific calculation simulation, differential equation solving and other issues involved in the quantification of derivatives.

### Interim：

Carry out quantitative financial cooperation research among domestic universities and enterprises through cooperative development and other models.

### Later Phase：

Carry out quantitative financial cooperation research on a global scale through task unveiling or competition PK and other modes.

## Quantitative Finance SIG Study Guide

### Preliminary basis：

Members are required to have a good grasp of the basic theory of derivatives pricing, have a certain foundation in mathematics and statistics, understand the mathematical model of quantitative finance and be able to reproduce it by hand, and have certain literature reading ability and code development ability.

### Advanced route：

  1. Understand the basic knowledge of the financial market, and financial derivatives such as options, arbitrage and pricing.

  2. Gradually learn the classic models of quantitative finance in the order of model complexity.

  3. Hands-on practice, using real-world data to conduct relevant financial analysis.
