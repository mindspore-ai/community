## MSAdapter SIG

### Introduction to Establishment Background

The AI framework, as an important infrastructure for artificial intelligence innovation, is promoting the accelerated progress of artificial intelligence technology and assisting in the intelligent transformation and upgrading of many industries. However, due to the relatively late start of domestic frameworks compared to international mainstream products, ecological construction needs to be accelerated. From the proportion of frameworks used in Papers with Code from 2016 to 2023, it can be seen that PyTorch holds a dominant position. To help users efficiently migrate PyTorch code to the Shengsi MindSpot ecosystem, Shengsi MindSpot and Pengcheng Laboratory jointly developed a Shengsi MindSpot ecological adaptation tool - MSAdapter.

### MSAdapter SIG Mission

MSAdapter SIG opens up new learning channels for developers of Shengsi MindSpot. The API of MSAdapter is designed entirely based on PyTorch, and users can easily run PyTorch code on the Ascension AI processor with just a few modifications. At present, MSAdapter has been adapted to over 800 interfaces such as torch, torch. nn, torch. nn. function, torch. linalg, etc; Full support for torch vision; And validated the migration of 70+mainstream Python models in MSAdapterModelZoo. At the same time, MSAdapter is open source in the Openl Qizhi community, which also provides inclusive NPU computing resources for everyone. We hope that everyone can learn to use MSAdapter, a Shengsi MindSpot ecological adaptation tool, on MSAdapter SIG.
