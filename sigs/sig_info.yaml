name: MindSpore SIG
description: The full name of SIG is "special interest groups". The intention of establishing various technical sigs is to provide an open communication platform for experts, professors and students in this field, promote technical exchanges and win-win cooperation through meeting sharing, project development and other activities, and improve the influence and technical ability of SIG members. Especially for college students, after joining SIGs, they can participate in the project development activities of MindSpore under the guidance of experts, master the advanced technology in the industry, and prepare for future work; You can also communicate face-to-face with industry experts and professors to solve your doubts in scientific research and meet your own bole. Up to now, MindSpore community has established more than ten sigs, including not only the front-end and back-end technologies of MindSpore framework itself, but also algorithm research such as AI security and scientific computing. We also welcome friends with ideas to create their own sigs!
