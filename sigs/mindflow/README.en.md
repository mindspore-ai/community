## 1.Establishment background

Computational fluid dynamics is closely related to the research and development of aerospace, marine equipment, energy, and power.    However, it still faces challenges and bottlenecks from mesh generation complexity.   Automatic mesh generation sometimes can not cope with complex boundary geometry.    Manual processing is necessary.  The simulation of fluid mechanics relies on complex iterative computation, which is limited by parallel efficiency.  Moreover, it is difficult to solve high-dimensional equations. Accuracy and performance need to be balanced.

These challenges also bring new opportunities for AI scientific computation.    With its parallel training and inferring ability, AI does not rely on grids.    It can quickly obtain results without iterative calculation.      AI has the ability to learn intrinsic laws from the physical world and to obtain results with high accuracy and performance.      In recent years, Google, Nvidia, and other major institutions have begun to apply AI to fluid mechanics research.   These works have received widespread attention.

Different from the mature deep learning kits of CV and NLP, there is still not a stable and easy-to-use model library or community in the field of AI fluid mechanics, which enables researchers to examine algorithms conveniently and develop models efficiently.

Therefore, building an open, easy-to-use, and efficient AI+ fluid mechanics library and community is conducive to the prosperity of fluid mechanics research and the wide application and innovation of AI.

In these circumstances, the MindFlow Special Interest Group ("MindFlow SIG") of Shengsi was formally established. SIG welcomes all like-minded partners from open-source communities.

## 2.Brief introduction

Focused on Shengsi MindFlow, in order to make full use of the advantages of MindSpore, improve the capabilities of kits and expand the community ecology, SIG provides an efficient and easy-to-use AI computational fluid simulation kit for scientific researchers, teachers, and students.  Furthermore, it offers a platform for those who have strong influence and interest in this field to communicate and cooperate.

## 3.Mission

Focusing on the application of AI in fluid mechanics. Exploring multiple AI fluid simulation modes such as physics-driven, data-driven and data-mechanism-fusion. Building AI+fluid computation framework with simple use and efficient operation. Supporting AI fluid research in aerospace, ship hydrodynamics, energy and power industries.

The key work of the group includes the following directions:

### Physics-driven AI fluid simulation

Physics-driven AI fluid simulation, i.e., introducing the physics equation into the loss function of the neural network.    Physics equations participate in network training to learn results that meet physical laws.  This module is mainly used for the forward and inverse solution of PDE equations and data assimilation.  At present, MindFlow provides APIs of common boundary, initial condition setting methods, sampling methods, loss function construction, etc., which meet the requirements for solving and optimizing relevant classical flow fields.

### Data-driven AI fluid simulation

The data-driven AI fluid simulation relies on a large amount of fluid simulation data.   The physical laws between data samples are learned by designing suitable neural networks that take the advantage of efficient parallelism and fast inference. Neural operators like FNO and DeepONet have certain parameter generalization capabilities.   These modules are mainly used for fast inference with a large amount of labeled data, parameter space design optimization, and other applications.   MindFlow now has network models such as ViT and FNO, which can solve classical flow (Burgers' equation, etc.) and flow problems faced in engineering practice.

### data-mechanism-fusion AI fluid simulation

AI fluid simulation based on data and mechanism fusion can learn partial differential equations from data and predict the dynamical properties of complex systems with high accuracy and uncover potential PDE models.  PDE-Net is one of the typical examples.  This model is mainly in small scientific data samples and known control equations.   It reduces the demand for data and improves the generalization of the network through built-in flow equations.  In addition, by coupling with a differentiable CFD solver and neural network, new applications such as AI correction, AI interpolation, and AI supersession of fluid simulation can be realized.  The basic API of PDE-Net is currently available to solve convection-diffusion equations.

### Differentiable CFD solver

Fluid simulation software solves the fluid control equations by numerical methods to analyze, predict and control fluid motion. It has a wide range of applications in aerospace, shipbuilding, and energy. Based on the AI framework, Shengsi MindFlow CFD differentiable solver has the advantages of jit(just-in-time compilation), vmap automatic vectorization, autograd end-to-end automatic differentiation, and support of different hardware.

MindFlow is a fluid simulation kit based on Shengsi MindSpore, which supports AI flow simulation in aerospace, ship hydrodynamics, and energy and power industries.  It is aimed to provide efficient and easy-to-use AI computational fluid simulation software for industrial research engineers, teachers, and students from universities.  MindFlow provides a variety of common features such as physics-driven, data-driven, and data-mechanism-fusion AI fluid simulation.

## 5.Work plan

The main focus is on members' academic exchange activities to provide a reference for MindFlow evolution and function improvement.  SIG will organize one large event and several small events every year.  We will organize campus tours every quarter.  SIG will hold a large summer school event every year.  We will invite core experts in the group and prepare multiple topics for several-day lectures.  The group teachers will lead members to conduct technology research, function expansion, and bug fixing.  Members are also free to use MindFlow software for their own research and development.  The group will post open-source internship tasks in the community for students and teachers to claim. Through cooperative development and other forms of cooperation, we will conduct collaborative research in the community and carry out more applications.
