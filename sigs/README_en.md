# SIGs - Special Interest Groups

The full name of SIG is "special interest group". We set up various technical sigs in MindSpore community to
provide an open communication platform for experts, professors and students in this field.
We hope that it can promote technical communication and win-win cooperation, and improve the influence and technical
ability of SIG members through meeting sharing, project development and other activities.
Especially for college students, after joining SIGs, they can participate in MindSpore's development activities
under the guidance of experts, in which they can master the advanced technology in the industry and prepare for future
work. They can also communicate face-to-face with industry experts and professors and meet their own Bole. Up to now,
more than ten sigs have been set up in MindSpore community, including not only the front-end and back-end technologies
of MindSpore framework itself, but also the research of upper algorithms such as AI security and scientific computing.
We also welcome friends with ideas to create their own sigs!

## Proposing a new SIG

New SIGs are created when there is sufficient interest in a topic area
and someone volunteers to be the lead for the group and submits a proposal to
the steering committee. The chair facilitates the discussion and helps
synthesize proposals and decisions.
