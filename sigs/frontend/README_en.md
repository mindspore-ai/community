# MindSpore FrontEnd Special Interest Group (SIG)

This is the working repo for the FrontEnd Special Interest Group (SIG). This repo contains all the artifacts, materials, meeting notes and proposals regarding **basic elements** , **operators and layers**, **training interfaces**, **distributed training**,  and any other frontend programs in MindSpore. Feedbacks and contributions are welcomed.

1. **Basic Elements**: Basic data structure definitions, including Parameter, Tensor, Cell and so on.
2. **Operators and Layers**: Provide operators and functions, neural network layers, loss functions and optimizers.
3. **Training Interfaces**: Interfaces for model training, evaluating and predicting, including high-level wrapped APIs, checkpoint related APIs, callbacks and so on.
4. **Distributed Training**: Interfaces for data parallel, model parallel or auto parallel. Common communication operators are also included.
