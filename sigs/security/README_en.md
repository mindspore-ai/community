# SIG Introduction

Trusted AI SIG focuses on models and data trusted technologies in the field of artificial intelligence, and is committed to building a safe and reliable AI computing framework, mainly including the following directions:
:

1. **AI Model's robustness and reliability**: Adversarial samples, adversarial training, explainable AI, data concept drift detection and model fault injection.
2. **Privacy protection**: Differential privacy training, federated learning, data masking, privacy-leakage evaluation.
3. **Model deployment security**: Model encryption and model obfuscation.
