# MindSpore Executor Special Interest Group (SIG)

This is the working repo for the Executor Special Interest Group (SIG). This repo contains all the artifacts, materials, meeting notes and proposals regarding **graph optimizing** , **graph compling**, **hardware runtime**, **diagnostics**, and any other backend programs in MindSpore. Feedbacks and contributions are welcomed.
1. **Graph Optimizing**: Similar to graph "complier", there are many Passes to fuse operators and optimize graphs.
2. **Graph Compling**: Allocating memory and other resources, compling graphs to generate runnable models.
3. **Hardware Runtime**: Interface for hardware, who supportes ascend910, gpu and cpu now.
4. **Diagnostics**: Provide some tools such as profiling, exporting graph ir and exporting operator data.
