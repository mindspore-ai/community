## OpenGADL Sig

### Establishment background introduction

We are currently at a stage where domestic AI ecological talents are scarce, in which the technical threshold for fine-tuning large models is high and the technical reserves are not yet complete. In order to promote the development of the domestic AI industry, we have to face the current problems. The cost of model migration is too high. The cost of AI model training is expensive, such as the GPT-3 training fee of 4.6 million US dollars. Talents in the AI ​​​​direction are scarce. With the application of the AI ​​field As the scale expands, the domestic AI talent gap is as high as 5 million+; development is complex and difficult, and the difficulty of algorithm development is a severe test for developers’ comprehensive capabilities. Application and deployment are even more related to NPU performance tuning and adaptation, so the threshold is low, free, and Domestic deep learning and large model fine-tuning tool software are the basis for talent training and ecological construction.

### OpenGADL SIG Mission

OpenGADL SIG, the Special Interest Group for Large Model Automated Deep Learning Technology, is an ecological "base" for open source algorithm development and application of AI equipment based on OpenGADL software. OpenGADL software is a domestic AI chip algorithm design tool software that is localized, full-stack, automated and graphical, greatly reducing training costs. Edge-cloud collaboration implements a universal AI computing standard architecture, and the edge-end platform supports data management, model construction, model deployment, model training, and model evaluation. The cloud platform can support the full process development of large models, including a series of operations such as data, training, fine-tuning, and deployment. We believe that we will cultivate our own towering trees on the "fertile soil" of OpenGADL.

### OpenGADL SIG target

- Focus on fine-tuning in vertical fields and study large-model deep learning automation technology;
- Promote the application of domestic artificial intelligence technology in the fields of national defense, education, and medical care;
- Promote cooperation and exchanges between domestic and foreign developers and enterprises, and cultivate high-quality AI talents;

### Focus

1. The use and application deployment of OpenGADL software;
2. Research large-model deep learning automation technology, deepen industrial cooperation, and promote industrial upgrading;
