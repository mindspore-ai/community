# SIGs - Special Interest Groups

As described in the MindSpore [governance](../governance.md), Special
Interest Groups (SIGs) are persistent groups responsible for specific parts of
the project. SIGs have open and transparent proceedings to develop goals and
implement code contributions. SIGs are also responsible for ongoing maintenance
of the code in their areas.

## Proposing a new SIG

New SIGs are created when there is sufficient interest in a topic area
and someone volunteers to be the lead for the group and submits a proposal to
the steering committee. The chair facilitates the discussion and helps
synthesize proposals and decisions.

## Joining a SIG

If you are interested in participating, please [join the discussion](https://mailweb.mindspore.cn/postorius/lists/)
in the respective list. Details about any upcoming meetings will also be shared
in the mailing list. SIG artifacts can be found in the current repository.
