## Summary
In face of widespread biodiversity loss, urgent and effective conservation actions are needed.  AI technology can act as a flexible, efficient, and innovative assistant to traditional conservation efforts in the fields of accelerating data collection workflow, enabling real-time feedback, supporting conservation decision making, etc. The AI4BC WG calls for developersâ€™ participation in biodiversity conservation, exploring AI solutions for conservation issues.

## Motivation
Biodiversity is the vital foundation for human existence, yet it has been rapidly declining in recent decades. To protect biodiversity and prevent it from future deterioration, biodiversity conservation needs to be mainstreamed and we need efforts from all sectors of society, among which the developer community can be an important force. AI technology can bring groundbreaking solutions to biodiversity data collection, decision support, and other conservation aspects. We hope to build a platform for developers and conservationists to work together to tackle conservation problems and facilitate biodiversity mainstreaming. 

## Goals
The goals for the AI for Biodiversity Conservation WG are as follows:
- To explore AI and machine learning solutions to conservation challenges, such as: 
    - To extend biodiversity dataset via data mining, NLP, image processing, etc.;
    - To accelerate and automate biodiversity data workflows;
    - To develop conservation decision support tools;
- To invite developers to participate in conservation projects, e.g., species record collection campaigns, and to learn about conservation issues.

## Method
We expect the applicant can conduct AI for Biodiversity Conservation research based on MindSpore, and hope to get your valuable suggestions to MindSpore in the process. We will do our best to improve the capabilities of the MindSpore framework and provide you with the most powerful technical support.
