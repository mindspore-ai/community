# MindSpore Security

MindSpore is a training and inference framework that supports device, edge, and cloud scenarios. It is widely used in various fields, such as terminals, edge computing, cloud services, network devices, storage devices, and 5G, and needs to meet application security requirements in preceding scenarios.

As a general-purpose computing framework, MindSpore can run on different chip platforms such as the CPU, GPU, and Ascend. Users provide data or models as the input and obtain training models or inference results. As core assets in the AI field, data and models are necessary for continuous security protection of AI systems.

We also provide suggestions on secure running of key components:

## MindSpore Community Security Issue Disclosure Process

After receiving the issues, we will handle the security issues according to the following process:

+ After receiving suspected security issues, the vulnerability management team (VMT) immediately confirms the integrity of reported information and issue severity.
+ Organize community teams to carry out technical analysis, confirm issue details, and provide analysis reports.
+ Confirm the vulnerability and apply for CVE, communicate with the vulnerability reporter about the issue, align the subsequent fixing and release plan, and prepare the security advisory (SA).
+ Complete vulnerability patch development/verification and initiate restricted disclosure.
+ Publicly release patches and security advisory (SA).

## MindSpore Community Vulnerability Management Team (VMT)

The VMT consists of vulnerability management experts in the community. The team is responsible for coordinating the entire process from vulnerability receiving to disclosure, including:

+ Vulnerability collection: Suspected security vulnerabilities discovered by community members and external researchers can be reported to the VMT through <mindspore-security@mindspore.cn>.
+ Vulnerability tracking and handling: The VMT will record the confirmed vulnerabilities in the MindSpore community, confirm and fix the vulnerabilities, and keep effective communication with the reporter during the process.
+ Responsible disclosure: After vulnerabilities are properly fixed, the VMT will release vulnerability information to the community in the form of SA.
